Hey, This is Jerry Shen

I majored in Management Information System at [Hangzhou Dianzi University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangzhou_Dianzi_University) and graduated in 2016. And then I studied for a master degree in Computer Science and Technology at [Zhejiang University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhejiang_University)

I am going to work at [FIT, Tencent](https://www.fitgroup.com) in 2019. As a software engineer, my main job is to improve the bank payment service at [TenPay](https://www.tenpay.com/v3/). 

I am concerned about `Cloud Computing`, `Distributed Technology`, `Software Architecture` and etc. And in the daily life, I like reading, no matter what the book focus on, as long as it's interesting. The more I see, the less I know for sure.

*A better Jerry is on the road......*
